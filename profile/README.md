Pressio is an ecosystem for developing, applying and using projection-based model reduction (pROM) methods. 
In particular, Pressio is aimed at mitigating the intrusive nature of pROMs for large-scale codes, and providing a framework to foster research of new ideas and as well as more broad testing.
